"needed a provision, by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its ",
"valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, ",
"in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland had so far ",
"gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no ",
"means unusual in children of two or three years old: an imperfect articu- ",
"lation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and ",
"a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention ",
"which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He ",
"meant not to be unkind, however, and as a mark of his affection for the ",
"three girls, he left them a thousand pounds apiece. ",

"Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was at first severe; but his temper ",
"was cheerful and sanguine, and he might reasonably hope to live many ",
"years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the ",
"produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate ",
"improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was ",
"his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten ",
"thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for ",
"his widow and daughters. ",
"",
"His son was sent for, as soon as his danger was known, and to him ",
"Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which ",
"illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters. ",
"",
"Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the ",
"family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at ",
"such a time, and he promised to do everything in his power to make ",
"them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance, ",
"and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there ",
"might prudently be in his power to do for them. ",
"",
"He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold-hearted, ",
"and rather selfish, is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well ",
"respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of ",
"his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might ",
"have been made still more respectable than he was ; he might even have ",
"been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and ",
"very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature ",
"of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish. ",
"",
"When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself ",
"to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds ",
"apiece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The prospect of four ",
"thousand a year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining ",
"half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart and made him feel ",
"capable of generosity. \"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: ",
"it would be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make them com- ",
"pletely easy. Three thousand pounds! He could spare so considerable a ",
"sum with little inconvenience.\" He thought of it all day long, and for ",
"many days successively, and he did not repent. ",
