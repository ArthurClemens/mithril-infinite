"MRS. DASHWOOD remained at Norland several months; not from any ",
"disinclination to move when the sight of every well-known spot ceased to ",
"raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when her ",
"spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other ",
"exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remem- ",
"brances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries ",
"for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove ",
"",
"far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could hear of no ",
"situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease, and ",
"suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment ",
"rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother ",
"would have approved. ",
"",
"Mrs. Dash wood had been informed by her husband of the solemn ",
"promise on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his ",
"last earthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no ",
"more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her ",
"daughters' sake with satisfaction, though, as for herself, she was per- ",
"suaded that a much smaller provision than seven thousand pounds would ",
"support her in affluence. For their brother's sake too, for the sake of his ",
"own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to ",
"his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His attentive ",
"behaviour to herself and his sisters, convinced her that their welfare ",
"was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the liberality ",
"of his intentions. ",
"",
"The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for ",
"her daughter-in-law was very much increased by the further knowledge ",
"of her character, which half-a-year's residence in her family afforded; ",
"and, perhaps, in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal ",
"affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it ",
"impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular circum- ",
"stance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to the opinions ",
"of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland. ",
"",
"This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl ",
"and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanlike and pleasing ",
"young man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his ",
"sister's establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest ",
"part of his time there. ",
"",
"Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of ",
"interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died ",
"very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence, ",
"for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the will ",
"of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either con- ",
"sideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable, that he ",
"loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality. It was con- ",
"trary to every doctrine of hers, that difference of fortune should keep any ",
"couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition; and ",
"that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by everyone who knew ",
"her, was to her comprehension impossible. ",
"",
"Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any ",
"peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his ",
"manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident ",
"to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his ",
"beteviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His under-"
