"world of Edward's heart.. But you look grave, Marianne; do you dis- ",
"approve your sister's choice?\" ",

"\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it with some surprise. ",
"Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet, he is not the ",
"kind of young man there is a something wanting, his figure is not ",
"striking it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who ",
"could seriously attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, ",
"which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am ",
"afraid, mamma, he has no real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract him, ",
"and though he admires Elinor's drawings very much, it is not the admira- ",
"tion of a person who can understand their worth. It is evident, in spite of ",
"his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows ",
"nothing of the matter. He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. To ",
"satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could not be happy with ",
"a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must ",
"enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm ",
"us both. O mamma! how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in ",
"reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore ",
"it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly ",
"keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost ",
"driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dread- ",
"ful indifference!\" ",

"\"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant ",
"prose. I thought so at the time; but you would give him Cowper.\" ",
"",
"\"Nay, mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper! but we must ",
"allow for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she ",
"may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke my ",
"heart had I loved him, to h2ar him read with so little sensibility. Mamma, ",
"the more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never ",
"see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He must have all ",
"Edward's virtues, and his person and manners must ornament his good- ",
"ness with every possible charm.\" ",
"",
"\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early ",
"in life to despair of such an happiness. Why should you be less fortunate ",
"than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your ",
"destiny be different from hers ! \" "
